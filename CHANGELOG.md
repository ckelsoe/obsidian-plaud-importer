# Changelog

All notable changes to Plaud Importer will be documented in this file.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-04-21

Duplicate handling: new "Ask each time" policy.

- Settings dropdown adds third option **Ask each time** (new default for fresh installs; existing users keep whatever they had saved)
- Per-duplicate prompt shows the recording title and target path, explicit warning that existing note content AND the matching `-assets` folder will be overwritten
- Five-button modal: `Overwrite`, `Skip`, `Overwrite all remaining`, `Skip all remaining`, `Cancel import` — the last two set a sticky batch-level decision so 20-file re-imports don't re-prompt
- Cancel stops the batch mid-run and fires a partial-progress notice
- `NoteWriter` grows an optional `promptOnDuplicate` callback; new `NoteWriterCancelledError` bubbles cancel cleanly (not treated as an import failure)

Motivation: retranscribing a recording (e.g. applying speaker names) and re-importing it used to silently no-op when the duplicate policy was "skip", which was the default. The new "Ask each time" default makes overwrite an explicit per-file decision rather than a global toggle the user forgets about.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-04-14

Initial scaffold.

- Plugin class with settings persistence and deferred `onLayoutReady` hook
- Settings tab with three controls: `SecretComponent` for the Plaud token (using Obsidian's per-vault secret storage), output folder text input, and duplicate-handling dropdown (`skip` / `overwrite`)
- Command palette entry `Plaud Importer: Import recent recordings` (currently produces a "not implemented" notice — real client to come)
- `isDesktopOnly: true`, `minAppVersion: 1.11.4` (required for `SecretStorage` and `SecretComponent`)
- Build pipeline (esbuild + tsc typecheck), lint (eslint), test (jest), release automation (version-bump.mjs) carried forward from the `obsidian-shell-path-copy` template
